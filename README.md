# Change the gamemode

Create a new C++ Class :
Show all class and find GameMode and create your class
Then create a blueprint by using the class we've just create 
Go project settings : Maps & Modules -> Select the BluePrint of the GameMode we've just create -> the Default Pawn Class by giving the BluePrint of the new Character you want to add by default.

Here are the class : https://github.com/Aladin-Saleh/Learn_Unreal_Engine4_C/tree/main/GameMode
